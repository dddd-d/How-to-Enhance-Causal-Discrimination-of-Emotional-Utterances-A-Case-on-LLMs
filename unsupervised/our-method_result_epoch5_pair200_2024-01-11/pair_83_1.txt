NO implicit:
Q: Here are two utterances: (1) Look ! This picture of Mom in her cap and gown .(2) Isn't it lovely ! That's when she got her Master's Degree from Miami University .                                Is there a emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2)?  Let's think step by step.
A: To determine if there is an emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2), we need to analyze the sequence of events and emotions conveyed in the utterances.

In utterance (1), the speaker points out a picture of Mom in her cap and gown. This does not explicitly indicate any specific emotional response, so we cannot conclude an emotional cause from this utterance alone.

In utterance (2), the speaker expresses admiration or positive emotion by exclaiming, "Isn't it lovely!" while mentioning that Mom received her Master's Degree from Miami University. This suggests that the speaker finds the event of Mom obtaining her Master's Degree to be a positive and praiseworthy achievement, thus establishing an emotional response to the mentioned event.

Therefore, while utterance (1) does not convey a clear emotional cause, utterance (2) does establish an emotional response, indicating a possible emotional cause-and-effect relationship between the two utterances.

Q: Judge the direction of the relationship:                                        Dose utterance (1) causes utterance (2) or Dose utterance (2) causes utterance (1) ?
A: Based on the analysis provided, utterance (1) does not explicitly cause utterance (2) as it does not convey a clear emotional response. Therefore, the direction of the relationship suggests that utterance (2) causes utterance (1), as the positive emotions expressed in utterance (2) prompt the speaker to reference the picture and express admiration in utterance (1).
