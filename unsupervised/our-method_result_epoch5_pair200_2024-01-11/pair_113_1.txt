Q: Here are two utterances: (1) Did you hear about Joe ? She hasn't eaten for days .(2) Why ? What's eating her ?                                Is there a emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2)?  Let's think step by step.
A: Yes, there appears to be an emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2). 

In utterance (1), the speaker mentions that Joe hasn't eaten for days, implying that there is something wrong or troubling him. This sets the emotional context for the conversation.

In utterance (2), the speaker asks "Why? What's eating her?" This indicates that the speaker is linking Joe's lack of eating (emotional cause) to something troubling or bothering him (emotional effect). The phrase "what's eating her" suggests that there is some underlying emotional issue or concern that is affecting Joe's appetite.

Therefore, utterance (2) is a response to the given information in utterance (1), indicating a cause-and-effect relationship between the emotional state of Joe and his not eating.

Q: Judge the direction of the relationship:                                        Dose utterance (1) causes utterance (2) or Dose utterance (2) causes utterance (1) ?
A: The direction of the relationship is that utterance (1) causes utterance (2). The mention of Joe not eating for days in utterance (1) sets the emotional context and prompts the question in utterance (2) about what may be bothering or troubling Joe.
