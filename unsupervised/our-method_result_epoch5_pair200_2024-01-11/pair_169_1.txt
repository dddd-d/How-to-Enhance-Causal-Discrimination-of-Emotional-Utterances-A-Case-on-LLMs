A: No . I'd like a slide , I have a new projector .
B: I'd like to see that myself .

NO implicit:
Q: Here are two utterances: (1) No . I'd like a slide , I have a new projector .(2) I'd like to see that myself .                                Is there a emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2)?  Let's think step by step.
A: Step 1: Analyzing utterance (1)
Utterance (1) states "No. I'd like a slide, I have a new projector." Without any context, it seems that the speaker is responding negatively to a previous statement or request. They express their own desire for a slide, presumably to use with their new projector.

Step 2: Analyzing utterance (2)
Utterance (2) states "I'd like to see that myself." Again, without context, it is unclear what "that" refers to. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the speaker wants to personally witness or experience something.

Step 3: Identifying emotional cause-and-effect relationship
Based on the given utterances alone, it is difficult to determine a clear emotional cause-and-effect relationship between them. Utterance (1) does not explicitly mention any emotional state or response, other than potentially expressing frustration or disagreement. Utterance (2) also lacks emotional markers. Therefore, it is challenging to establish a direct emotional connection between the two utterances.

However, it's important to note that without additional context, the emotional nuances of these utterances may be unclear, and any potential emotional relationship could be better understood within a broader conversation or scenario.
