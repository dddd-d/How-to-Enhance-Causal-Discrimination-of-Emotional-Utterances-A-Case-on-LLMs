Q: Here are two utterances: (1) Wonderful ! A modest , comfortable room . Ah , a beautiful window , through which I can see a beautiful scene , and hear the birds singing . How nice !(2) Excellent ! I like it ! When can I move in ?                                Is there a emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2)?  Let's think step by step.
A: Step 1: Analyzing utterance (1)
Utterance (1) expresses positive emotions such as wonder, comfort, and appreciation. The speaker is delighted with the room and is enjoying the beautiful view and sounds. Overall, it conveys a sense of contentment and satisfaction.

Step 2: Analyzing utterance (2)
Utterance (2) also expresses positive emotions, but it goes further by expressing a desire to move into the room. The speaker likes it and wants to make it their living space. It indicates a stronger emotional response and a desire for further action.

Step 3: Identifying the emotional cause-and-effect relationship
Based on the analysis of the two utterances, it can be inferred that there is an emotional cause-and-effect relationship between them. Utterance (1) initiates the positive emotions and appreciation for the room, which leads to the desire expressed in utterance (2) to move in and make it their own. The positive emotions from utterance (1) contribute to the decision expressed in utterance (2) to take action and potentially rent or move into the room.

In summary, utterance (1) evokes positive emotions, setting the foundation for the desire and excitement expressed in utterance (2) to move into the room.

Q: Judge the direction of the relationship:                                        Dose utterance (1) causes utterance (2) or Dose utterance (2) causes utterance (1) ?
