We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry .(2) Good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ?                                Is there a emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2)?  Let's think step by step.
A: Based on the given utterances, it is possible to infer an emotional cause-and-effect relationship between them. Let's analyze it step by step:

1. In utterance (1), the speaker mentions that there is a nearby motor company open to the public every weekend. They express interest in visiting and learning more about the automobile industry.

2. In utterance (2), the second speaker responds positively, saying it is a good idea. They express that they have always been interested in the topic mentioned in utterance (1).

From this analysis, it can be inferred that utterance (1) sparks the interest and enthusiasm of the second speaker in utterance (2). Thus, there is an emotional cause-and-effect relationship between the two utterances, where utterance (1) triggers a positive emotional response in utterance (2).

Q: Judge the direction of the relationship:                                        Dose utterance (1) causes utterance (2) or Dose utterance (2) causes utterance (1) ?
A: The direction of the relationship is that utterance (1) causes utterance (2). The speaker in utterance (1) mentions the nearby motor company and expresses interest in visiting and learning more about the automobile industry.
