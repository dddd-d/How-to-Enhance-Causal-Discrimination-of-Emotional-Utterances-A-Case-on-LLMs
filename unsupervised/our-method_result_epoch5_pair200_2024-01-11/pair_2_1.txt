Consider about the content of utterances and their implicit causes, is there a emotional cause-and-effective relationship between the utterance (1) and utterance (2)? Let's think step by step.
A: Yes, there is an emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2). 

When the speaker in utterance (1) shares their accomplishment of getting a job at a consulting firm, they do so with the goal of impressing or exciting Matt. This achievement contributes to the speaker's sense of happiness.

Therefore, the emotional cause in utterance (1) (the speaker's happiness) has an effect on the emotional response in utterance (2) (Matt's congratulations and happiness for the speaker).

Q: Judge the direction of the relationship:                                         Dose utterance (1) causes utterance (2) or Dose utterance (2) causes utterance (1) ?
