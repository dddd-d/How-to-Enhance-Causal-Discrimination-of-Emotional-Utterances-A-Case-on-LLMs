NO implicit:
Q: Here are two utterances: (1) Nobody is OK , but you !(2) Yes , I did .                                Is there a emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2)?  Let's think step by step.
A: To determine if there is an emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2), we need to analyze the context and underlying emotions in each utterance.

In utterance (1), the statement "Nobody is OK, but you!" implies that the speaker perceives everyone else as not being okay, except for the person they are addressing. This could potentially indicate a feeling of relief or gratitude towards the person being referred to as "you." However, without additional context, it is not possible to definitively determine the exact emotions or the relationship between them.

In utterance (2), the simple acknowledgement "Yes, I did" does not directly reveal any specific emotions. It merely confirms that the speaker did something without specifying what that action is. Therefore, it is difficult to establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2) based solely on the provided utterances.

In order to identify a potential emotional cause-and-effect, we would require more information or context surrounding the utterances, such as the preceding conversation, facial expressions, tone of voice, or non-verbal cues.

Utterance (1): Nobody is OK , but you !The implicit cause of utterance (1) is "The speaker desires to stand out and be seen as exceptional, potentially stemming from feelings of insecurity or a need for individual recognition."

Consider about the content of utterances and their implicit causes, is there a emotional cause-and-effective relationship between the utterance (1) and utterance (2)? Let's think step by step.
A: In analyzing the emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2), we can examine the content and the implicit causes of both utterances.

Utterance (1) expresses a sense of exceptionality and uniqueness, potentially driven by feelings of insecurity or a need for individual recognition. This implies a desire for validation and a search for emotional support.

Utterance (2) acknowledges an affirmative response, indicating that the speaker did something. The implicit cause behind this utterance is a sense of happiness and a need to validate their competence and expertise in a specific domain or field.

Considering the content of both utterances, it is possible to identify a potential emotional cause-and-effect relationship. Utterance (1) reflects a desire for recognition and validation, while utterance (2) represents the fulfillment of that desire through the speaker's acknowledgment of their achievement or action.

Therefore, one could argue that utterance (1) may have influenced utterance (2) by creating the emotional drive for the speaker to validate their competence and expertise. In this way, there is a potential emotional cause-and-effect relationship between the two utterances.

Q: Judge the direction of the relationship:                                         Dose utterance (1) causes utterance (2) or Dose utterance (2) causes utterance (1) ?

A: Based on the information provided, it is difficult to establish a direct emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2). Utterance (1) focuses on the speaker being the only one who is okay, which represents resilience and strength, while utterance (2) simply acknowledges that the speaker did something. 

However, if we consider the possibility that the speaker's resilience and strength in utterance (1) could have influenced their ability to accomplish something, then we could argue that there is an indirect emotional cause-and-effect relationship. In this hypothetical scenario, the speaker's emotional state in utterance (1) could have propelled them to take action, leading to the accomplishment mentioned in utterance (2). 

Ultimately, without further context or explicit information about the emotional state of the speaker, it is challenging to firmly establish an emotional cause-and-effect relationship between these two utterances.
