Step 2: Examining the emotional cause of utterance (2) - expressing appreciation and being moved by someone. This also suggests a positive and uplifting emotion.

Step 3: Comparing the emotional causes of both utterances. Both utterances seem to stem from a similar emotional cause of wanting to uplift and make others feel good. They both have a positive affective drive behind them.

Step 4: Evaluating the effective relationship between the two utterances. While there is a similarity in the emotional cause, it does not necessarily imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2). The emotions behind these utterances are parallel, but they may occur independently of each other.

In conclusion, there is a similarity in emotional cause between utterance (1) and utterance (2), but there is no direct cause-and-effect relationship between them.

You look so beautiful today .
