Q: Here are two utterances: (1) I ' Ve been to Qingdao before , so I ' ll choose Dalian . I've heard that the environment there is very good .(2) Yes , that's a good place to spend a holiday . Last year I went there . It's really .                                Is there a emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2)?  Let's think step by step.
A: To determine if there is an emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2), let's analyze step by step:

1. Utterance (1) states, "I 'Ve been to Qingdao before, so I 'll choose Dalian. I've heard that the environment there is very good."

- Utterance (1) indicates that the speaker has been to Qingdao before and chooses to go to Dalian instead. The reason for this choice is that the speaker has heard that the environment in Dalian is very good. This implies a positive emotion towards Dalian's environment.

2. Utterance (2) states, "Yes, that's a good place to spend a holiday. Last year I went there. It's really, ...".

- Utterance (2) supports the positive sentiment expressed in utterance (1) by stating that Dalian is a good place to spend a holiday. Furthermore, the speaker mentions that they went to Dalian last year, implying personal experience and reinforcement of the positive emotion associated with the place.

Therefore, based on the provided information, there seems to be an emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2). Utterance (1) presents positive information about the environment in Dalian, which leads to utterance (2) affirming that it is indeed a good place to spend a holiday based on personal experience.

Q: Judge the direction of the relationship:                                        Dose utterance (1) causes utterance (2) or Dose utterance (2) causes utterance (1) ?
A: The direction of the relationship is such that utterance (1) causes utterance (2). The positive information and recommendation provided in utterance (1) about the environment in Dalian lead to the agreement and confirmation expressed in utterance (2). Therefore, the cause of utterance (2) can be attributed to utterance (1).
