Q: Here are two utterances: (1) He certainly is . He is the Peckham in our collage .(2) Maybe he shouldn ' t come to collage , he should become a football star .                                Is there a emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2)?  Let's think step by step.
A: To determine if there is an emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2), we need to analyze the statements in each utterance.

1) "He certainly is. He is the Peckham in our collage."
This utterance implies that "he" (presumably a person) is identified as "the Peckham" in their collage. However, there is no explicit emotional content or indication of cause-and-effect in this statement.

2) "Maybe he shouldn't come to collage, he should become a football star."
This utterance suggests that "he" should reconsider attending college and pursue a career as a football star instead. While there is a potential decision being discussed, there is again no clear emotional content or cause-and-effect relationship between this utterance and the previous one.

Based on the provided information, there is no apparent emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2).

Implicit:
Q: Here are two utterances and their implicit causes for speakers to say them.                                 Utterance (1): He certainly is . He is the Peckham in our collage .The implicit cause of utterance (1) is "The goal is to signal a shared identity or connection with the mentioned person, generating a feeling of unity or camaraderie."                                 Utterance (2): Maybe he shouldn ' t come to collage , he should become a football star .The implicit cause of utterance (2) is "The speaker might have witnessed the person's dissatisfaction or unhappiness in previous academic experiences, leading them to believe that pursuing a different path would bring joy to the individual."                                 Consider about the content of utterances and their implicit causes, is there a emotional cause-and-effective relationship between the utterance (1) and utterance (2)? Let's think step by step.
A: There is not necessarily an emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2) based solely on the information provided. Utterance (1) is about identifying a person as a part of a particular community, creating a sense of unity. Utterance (2), on the other hand, suggests a potential alternative path for the person. These utterances focus on different aspects and goals - one on connection and unity, and the other on future aspirations. 

However, it is possible that a specific emotional cause influenced both utterances, but without more information, it cannot be determined. For example, if the speaker felt a strong sense of camaraderie with the person mentioned in utterance (1) and also observed their unhappiness in previous academic experiences (as mentioned in utterance 2). In this case, the emotional cause could be the speaker's concern for the person's well-being and desire to see them happy in their chosen path. But again, this is a speculative scenario and not necessarily evident from the given information.

He is the Peckham in our collage .The implicit cause of utterance (1) is "The implicit cause is to encourage others in the collage to strive for greatness, motivated by the example set by the mentioned person's exceptional skills and dedication."                                 Utterance (2): Maybe he shouldn ' t come to collage , he should become a football star .The implicit cause of utterance (2) is "The speaker's affective drive stems from their belief that the mentioned person's true passion and happiness lie in becoming a football star rather than pursuing higher education."                                 Consider about the content of utterances and their implicit causes, is there a emotional cause-and-effective relationship between the utterance (1) and utterance (2)? Let's think step by step.
A: Yes, there appears to be an emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2). 

In utterance (1), the speaker expresses admiration and praise for someone in their collage, highlighting their exceptional skills and dedication. This is likely to evoke a positive emotional response from the speaker and potentially others, such as inspiration, motivation, or a sense of admiration.

In utterance (2), the speaker suggests that the mentioned person should pursue a career as a football star instead of attending collage. This implies a belief that becoming a football star would bring more happiness and fulfillment to the person. This suggestion could be fueled by the positive emotions evoked in utterance (1), as the speaker may perceive the person's exceptional skills and dedication as indicative of potential success in the field of football.

Therefore, utterance (2) could be seen as a result of the emotional impact caused by utterance (1), as the speaker reacts to the admiration and dazzlement experienced earlier.
