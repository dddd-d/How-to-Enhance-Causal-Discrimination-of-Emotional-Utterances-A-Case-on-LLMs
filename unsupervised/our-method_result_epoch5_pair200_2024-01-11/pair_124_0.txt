NO implicit:
Q: Here are two utterances: (1) I ' m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ' s simply just too old ! That ' s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ' t much I can do .(2) This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ' ll give you your money back !                                Is there a emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2)?  Let's think step by step.
A: Step 1: Analyzing utterance (1)
In utterance (1), the speaker apologizes and explains that the computer is not broken or damaged, but rather too old, which is causing the programs and applications to run slowly. The speaker also expresses their inability to do much about the situation.

Step 2: Analyzing utterance (2)
In utterance (2), the speaker confidently states that the PC is top of the line and guarantees that it will never freeze. Furthermore, they offer a money-back guarantee if it does.

Step 3: Identifying the emotional cause-and-effect relationship
Based on the analysis of both utterances, it can be observed that utterance (2) is a direct response to utterance (1). Utterance (1) highlights the problem and expresses the speaker's helplessness in resolving it, while utterance (2) counters those concerns by assuring the customer of the PC's quality and offering a guarantee.

Therefore, the emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2) is that utterance (2) aims to alleviate the potential negative emotions caused by utterance (1) and provide reassurance to the customer.

It ' s simply just too old ! That ' s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ' t much I can do .The implicit cause of utterance (1) is "The speaker's affective drive is to provide exceptional customer service, but the outdated technology impedes their ability to do so, causing a sense of sadness and dissatisfaction."                                 Utterance (2): This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ' ll give you your money back !The implicit cause of utterance (2) is "The speaker's affective drive is fueled by the fear of negative customer experiences and their desire to avoid potential damage to their reputation."                                 Consider about the content of utterances and their implicit causes, is there a emotional cause-and-effective relationship between the utterance (1) and utterance (2)? Let's think step by step.
A: Based on the description provided, it is possible to identify an emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2). 

Utterance (1) conveys a sense of sadness and dissatisfaction on the part of the speaker due to the limitations imposed by outdated technology. This emotional state might lead the speaker to feel frustrated and underperform in their customer service role.

In contrast, utterance (2) reflects a strong emotional drive to provide exceptional customer service and avoid negative experiences. The speaker appears to be motivated by fear and a desire to protect their reputation, which they express through a guarantee and a promise to refund money if the PC freezes.

These two utterances present opposing emotional states and motivations. While utterance (1) is characterized by sadness and a sense of limitation, utterance (2) showcases confidence and a proactive approach to addressing customer concerns. Therefore, the emotional cause-and-effect relationship between these two utterances can be seen as a response to the limitations expressed in utterance (1), leading the speaker to adopt an assertive and confident stance in utterance (2) to counterbalance the negative impression.
