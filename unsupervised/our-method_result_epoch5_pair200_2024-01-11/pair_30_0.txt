NO implicit:
Q: Here are two utterances: (1) OK , great Daddy , after supper , I'll embark on it .(2) Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow , who wants to find the treasure on the sea ?                                Is there a emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2)?  Let's think step by step.
A: To determine if there is an emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2), let's analyze them step by step:

1. Utterance (1): "OK, great Daddy, after supper, I'll embark on it."
2. Utterance (2): "Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow, who wants to find the treasure on the sea?"

Based on these utterances alone, there is no clear emotional cause-and-effect relationship. Utterance (1) expresses agreement or acceptance of a task, while utterance (2) asks if the topic being discussed is related to Captain Jack Sparrow and his pursuit of treasure. 

The utterances appear to be independent and unrelated in terms of emotional cause-and-effect. However, without additional context or information about the speaker's emotional state, it is challenging to definitively determine any underlying emotional relationship.
