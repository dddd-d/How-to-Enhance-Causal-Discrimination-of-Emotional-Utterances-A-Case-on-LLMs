NO implicit:
Q: Here are two utterances: (1) I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ?(2) I drink a lot of wine .                                Is there a emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2)?  Let's think step by step.
A: To determine if there is an emotional cause-and-effect relationship between the two utterances, let's analyze them step by step:

Utterance (1): "I don't know how to adjust my life. Would you give me a piece of advice?"

This utterance suggests that the speaker is seeking guidance or help in adjusting their life. It indicates a possible emotional state of confusion or dissatisfaction, as they express a lack of knowledge or direction in making necessary changes.

Utterance (2): "I drink a lot of wine."

This utterance reveals a behavior of consuming a significant amount of wine. It doesn't explicitly mention any emotional state, though excessive alcohol consumption can be associated with various emotional issues such as stress, sadness, or attempts to cope with negative emotions.

Based on these utterances alone, it is difficult to establish a direct emotional cause-and-effect relationship between them. However, it is possible that the emotional state reflected in utterance (1) could contribute to the behavior mentioned in utterance (2). It would require further context and information to definitively determine the relationship between the two utterances.

Would you give me a piece of advice ?The implicit cause of utterance (1) is "A fear of failure or making wrong decisions in life is causing the speaker to feel overwhelmed and sad."                                 Utterance (2): I drink a lot of wine .The implicit cause of utterance (2) is "The speaker could have recently gone through a breakup or loss, leading them to seek comfort in alcohol."

A: Step 1: Analyzing the content of the utterances:

- Utterance (1) expresses a feeling of uncertainty and a request for advice on how to adjust one's life.
- Utterance (2) reveals that the speaker drinks a lot of wine.

Step 2: Identifying the implicit causes:

- Utterance (2) suggests that the speaker may be seeking comfort in alcohol due to a recent breakup or loss.

In this case, there might be an indirect emotional connection between the two utterances, but not a direct cause-and-effect relationship.

Would you give me a piece of advice ?The implicit cause of utterance (1) is "The speaker's yearning for a positive change and improvement in their life is met with confusion and uncertainty, causing them sadness and discontentment."                                 Utterance (2): I drink a lot of wine .The implicit cause of utterance (2) is "The speaker's affective drive could be rooted in their longing for emotional release and catharsis, using wine as a means to express and cope with their sadness."                                 Consider about the content of utterances and their implicit causes, is there a emotional cause-and-effective relationship between the utterance (1) and utterance (2)? Let's think step by step.
A: Based on the given information, it is possible to identify a potential emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2). 

Utterance (1) expresses the speaker's sadness and discontentment in not knowing how to adjust their life. This implies that they desire a positive change and improvement in their current situation. 

Utterance (2) reveals that the speaker drinks a lot of wine. This could be seen as a coping mechanism or means of emotional release. 

It is plausible to suggest that the emotional cause expressed in utterance (1) could lead to the affective drive seen in utterance (2). The speaker's yearning for a positive change and confusion in dealing with life could result in seeking emotional release or catharsis through drinking wine.

However, it's important to note that this relationship is based on interpretation and speculation since the information does not explicitly state a direct causal link between the two utterances. Further context or information would be necessary to fully establish the emotional cause-and-effect relationship between these utterances.

Q: Judge the direction of the relationship:                                         Dose utterance (1) causes utterance (2) or Dose utterance (2) causes utterance (1) ?
A: Based on the given information, it is implied that utterance (1) causes utterance (2). The speaker's yearning for a positive change and confusion about adjusting their life leads to their affective drive, which manifests as the speaker drinking a lot of wine. Therefore, utterance (1) causes utterance (2).

Q: Here are two utterances and their implicit causes for speakers to say them.                                 Utterance (1): I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ?The implicit cause of utterance (1) is "The speaker's emotional state is driven by their fear of making mistakes or wrong decisions while trying to adjust their life, heightening their sadness and anxiety."                                 Utterance (2): I drink a lot of wine .The implicit cause of utterance (2) is "The speaker's affective drive may be motivated by a need to self-soothe and find solace in the numbing effects of wine, especially when feeling sad."                                 Consider about the content of utterances and their implicit causes, is there a emotional cause-and-effective relationship between the utterance (1) and utterance (2)? Let's think step by step.
A: Step 1: Analyzing the content of utterances and their implicit causes
- Utterance (1) expresses the speaker's emotional state of sadness and anxiety related to adjusting their life and seeking advice.
- Utterance (2) reveals the speaker's motivation to drink a lot of wine as a means of self-soothing, possibly due to feeling sad.

Step 2: Identifying the emotional cause-and-effect relationship
There seems to be an emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2). The emotional state described in utterance (1) indicates the speaker's heightened sadness and anxiety. As a result, the speaker seeks solace and self-soothing, leading to the behavior described in utterance (2) of drinking a lot of wine.

Overall, the emotional cause-and-effect relationship between the two utterances suggests a potential connection where the speaker's emotional state in utterance (1) leads to the behavior described in utterance (2).

Q: Judge the direction of the relationship:                                         Dose utterance (1) causes utterance (2) or Dose utterance (2) causes utterance (1) ?
A: Based on the information provided, it appears that utterance (1) ("I don't know how to adjust my life. Would you give me a piece of advice?") causes utterance (2) ("I drink a lot of wine."). The emotional state described in utterance (1) drives the speaker's need for self-soothing, which is manifested in the behavior described in utterance (2) of drinking a lot of wine.
