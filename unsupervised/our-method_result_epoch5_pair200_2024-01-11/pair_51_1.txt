A: Based on the information provided, there does not appear to be a direct emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2). 

Utterance (1) expresses the speaker's overwhelming joy and satisfaction with the dinner. This does not necessarily lead to or cause utterance (2) about trying after-dinner wines. The content of utterance (2) seems more related to enhancing the overall mood and atmosphere, rather than directly stemming from the emotional response to the dinner.

However, it is possible that the positive emotions experienced from the dinner in utterance (1) contribute to the speaker's desire to continue enjoying the evening by suggesting to try some after-dinner wines in utterance (2). In this case, there might be an indirect emotional cause-and-effect relationship between the two utterances.

A: When we examine the content of the utterances, we can identify a possible emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2). 

In utterance (1), the speaker expresses delight and happiness towards the dinner, indicating a positive emotional state. This emotional state might prompt the speaker to engage in further conversation and deepen the emotional connection with the listener, leading to utterance (2).
