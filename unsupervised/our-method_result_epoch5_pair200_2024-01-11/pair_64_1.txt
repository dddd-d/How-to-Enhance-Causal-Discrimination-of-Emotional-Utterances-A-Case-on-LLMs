Q: Here are two utterances: (1) I can ' t believe it ! I have all my important personal documents stored in that computer . It ' s no laughing matter .(2) Well , you should be sorry ! Don ' t ever use my computer again ! You can ' t do anything now , it ' s too late !                                Is there a emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2)?  Let's think step by step.
A: Yes, there is an emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2). Let's analyze it step by step:

1. In utterance (1), the speaker expresses shock and disbelief about a situation involving their important personal documents being stored in a computer. This indicates a negative emotion, such as fear or worry, as they consider it a serious matter.

2. Utterance (2) follows as a response to the situation described in utterance (1). The speaker expresses anger and frustration, blaming the listener for the predicament. They demand an apology and assert that the listener can no longer do anything to remedy the situation, implying a sense of helplessness or regret.

Therefore, the emotional response in utterance (2) is a direct consequence of the emotional impact created by the situation described in utterance (1), establishing an emotional cause-and-effect relationship between the two utterances.

Q: Judge the direction of the relationship:                                        Dose utterance (1) causes utterance (2) or Dose utterance (2) causes utterance (1) ?

Utterance (2): Well , you should be sorry ! Don ' t ever use my computer again ! You can ' t do anything now , it ' s too late !The implicit cause of utterance (2) is "The speaker's goal is to assert their personal boundaries and ensure the listener understands the consequences of their actions."                                 Consider about the content of utterances and their implicit causes, is there a emotional cause-and-effective relationship between the utterance (1) and utterance (2)? Let's think step by step.
A: There is no direct emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2) based on the given information. Utterance (1) expresses frustration and concern about personal documents being stored in a computer, while utterance (2) expresses anger and the speaker's assertion of personal boundaries regarding computer usage. 
However, it is possible that the emotions underlying both utterances are related to a common trigger, such as an event or action that led to the speaker's computer being accessed without permission. Both utterances may stem from the same incident, illustrating the speaker's emotional response and their need for a resolution and assertion of boundaries. But without further information, it is not possible to establish a direct emotional cause-and-effect relationship between the two utterances.

Implicit:
Q: Here are two utterances and their implicit causes for speakers to say them.                                 Utterance (1): I can ' t believe it ! I have all my important personal documents stored in that computer . It ' s no laughing matter .The implicit cause of utterance (1) is "The speaker desires a resolution that restores their peace of mind, intensifying their anger when they perceive no immediate solution or assistance for their situation."                                 Utterance (2): Well , you should be sorry ! Don ' t ever use my computer again ! You can ' t do anything now , it ' s too late !The implicit cause of utterance (2) is "The speaker's goal is to assert their personal boundaries and establish clear rules for the listener's behavior in the future."                                 Consider about the content of utterances and their implicit causes, is there a emotional cause-and-effective relationship between the utterance (1) and utterance (2)? Let's think step by step.
A: Yes, there is a potential emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2). 

Utterance (1) expresses frustration and concern about the speaker's important personal documents being stored in a computer. The speaker desires a resolution that restores their peace of mind, intensifying their anger when they perceive no immediate solution or assistance for their situation.

Utterance (2) follows utterance (1) and expresses anger and a demand for accountability from the listener. The speaker asserts their personal boundaries and establishes clear rules for the listener's behavior in the future.

The emotional cause-and-effect relationship between the two utterances can be understood as follows: Utterance (1) triggers the speaker's frustration and anger, which then leads to utterance (2) as a way to express and assert their emotions. The intensity of the speaker's emotions in utterance (2) could be heightened by the lack of immediate resolution or assistance mentioned in utterance (1), making them more forceful in setting boundaries and expressing their dissatisfaction.

Overall, the emotional cause-and-effect relationship between these two utterances suggests a sequence of escalating frustration and anger for the speaker.

Q: Judge the direction of the relationship:                                         Dose utterance (1) causes utterance (2) or Dose utterance (2) causes utterance (1) ?
