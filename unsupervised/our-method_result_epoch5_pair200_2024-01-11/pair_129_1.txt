NO implicit:
Q: Here are two utterances: (1) Yes . You always have a good nose for wines .(2) Next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine .                                Is there a emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2)?  Let's think step by step.
A: To determine if there is an emotional cause-and-effect relationship between the two utterances, we can analyze the content and context of the sentences.

1) "Yes. You always have a good nose for wines."
This utterance suggests that the speaker acknowledges and agrees with the other person's ability to choose good wines. It implies a positive emotional response or admiration towards their wine expertise.

2) "Next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine."
In this utterance, the speaker proposes trying Canadian ice wine during their next meal together. There is no explicit emotional content in this sentence.

Based on this analysis, there does not seem to be a direct emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2). Utterance (1) may indirectly contribute to the speaker's suggestion in (2) by implying trust in the person's wine selection skills, but it does not directly cause the proposal to try Canadian ice wine.
