Consider about the content of utterances and their implicit causes, is there a emotional cause-and-effective relationship between the utterance (1) and utterance (2)? Let's think step by step.
A: Step 1: Analyzing the emotional cause of utterance (1)
The emotional cause of utterance (1) is to uplift the mood of the audience and create a positive atmosphere. This suggests a desire to make people feel good, happy, or comfortable. It is driven by a general positive affective drive.

Step 2: Analyzing the emotional cause of utterance (2)
The emotional cause of utterance (2) is joy and contentment that comes from connecting with others through acts of kindness and expressing gratitude. It involves the speaker expressing gratitude and warm greetings, indicating a positive emotional state. The speaker feels happy and content when connecting with others and expressing kindness.

Step 3: Examining the relationship between the two utterances
Both utterances have an underlying positive emotion, but they are driven by different motives. Utterance (1) aims to uplift the mood of the audience and create a positive atmosphere, while utterance (2) expresses gratitude and warm greetings. Although both utterances have positive intentions, they are not directly related in terms of emotional cause-and-effect. Each utterance has its own unique emotional drive and serves different purposes.

Q: Here are two utterances and their implicit causes for speakers to say them.                                 Utterance (1): Good evening . Welcome to our program .The implicit cause of utterance (1) is "The affective drive of the speaker is to bring joy and happiness to the listeners."                                 Utterance (2): Thank you . Good evening , Mr .

Let's think step by step.
A: Yes, there is a potential emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2). 

The emotional cause of utterance (1) is the speaker's desire to bring joy and happiness to the listeners. This positive affective drive may lead the speaker to express gratitude and kindness towards others, which could be the emotional cause behind utterance (2). By saying "Thank you" and addressing Mr. Dean kindly, the speaker is fostering a culture of gratitude and kindness, which aligns with their initial goal of bringing joy and happiness. 

In this way, utterance (1) and (2) are connected by a shared emotional cause of wanting to positively impact others' emotions and create a positive social environment.

Q: Judge the direction of the relationship:                                         Dose utterance (1) causes utterance (2) or Dose utterance (2) causes utterance (1) ?
A: Utterance (1) does not directly cause utterance (2), and utterance (2) does not directly cause utterance (1). The emotional cause driving both utterances is the speaker's desire to bring joy and happiness to others and foster gratitude and kindness. However, the utterances themselves are independent expressions of these emotions rather than causing one another.
