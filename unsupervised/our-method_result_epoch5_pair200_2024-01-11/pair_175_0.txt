Consider about the content of utterances and their implicit causes, is there a emotional cause-and-effective relationship between the utterance (1) and utterance (2)? Let's think step by step.
A: In analyzing the emotional cause-and-effect relationship between utterance (1) and utterance (2), we can consider the content and the implicit causes of both utterances.

Utterance (1) expresses gratitude and the speaker's joy in being able to express it. The emotional cause behind utterance (1) is the speaker's positive emotions of joy and gratitude.

Utterance (2) suggests singing "Happy Birthday" to Mary and indicates the speaker's anticipation of positive emotions and memories associated with this activity. The emotional cause behind utterance (2) is the speaker's anticipation of positive emotions and the joy associated with singing the birthday song.

Based on this analysis, we can observe a potential emotional connection between the two utterances. Both utterance (1) and utterance (2) involve positive emotions and expressions of joy. The emotion of joy is present in both utterances, indicating a potential emotional cause-and-effect relationship between them.

However, it is important to note that the connection between the two utterances is indirect. Utterance (2) does not directly reference or respond to utterance (1), but rather presents a separate scenario related to celebrating Mary's birthday. Therefore, while there may be a general alignment in terms of positive emotions and joy between the two utterances, they are not directly connected in terms of content or explicit causality.
