1. Utterance (1): "Isn't that a scary movie?"
   - This utterance expresses concern or fear about the movie.

2. Utterance (2): "How scary can it be? Come on, it'll be fun."
   - This utterance suggests reassurance or dismissal of the fear expressed in utterance (1).
   - The speaker is trying to convince the other person that the movie won't be too scary and that they should embrace the experience as something enjoyable.

Thus, utterance (1) triggers a fear-related concern, and utterance (2) attempts to counteract that fear by downplaying it and encouraging a positive outlook.

Utterance (1): Isn't that a scary movie ?The implicit cause of utterance (1) is "The speaker's intention to gauge their own emotional response and physiological reactions while watching the movie affects their neutral emotion."                                 Utterance (2): How scary can it be ? Come on , it'll be fun .The implicit cause of utterance (2) is "The speaker's goal of creating lasting memories and shared laughter with others motivates their neutral emotion, as they question the scariness, envisioning a fun and enjoyable time together."                                 Consider about the content of utterances and their implicit causes, is there a emotional cause-and-effective relationship between the utterance (1) and utterance (2)? Let's think step by step.
A: Step 1: Analyzing the content of utterances
Utterance (1) expresses the speaker's perception of a movie as being scary and seeks confirmation or agreement from the listener. It reflects the speaker's own emotional response and physiological reactions.
Utterance (2) questions the level of scariness of the movie and suggests that it will actually be fun and enjoyable. It reflects the speaker's desire to create lasting memories and shared laughter with others.

Step 2: Identifying the emotional cause-and-effect relationship
There is a clear emotional cause-and-effect relationship between the two utterances. Utterance (1) triggers a response in the speaker, leading them to question the scariness of the movie in utterance (2) and emphasize the potential for fun. The speaker's initial fear or concern about the movie's scariness causes them to seek reassurance and generate positive emotions in utterance (2).

In summary, utterance (1) sets off a chain of thoughts and emotions in the speaker, leading to utterance (2) where they question the scariness and focus on the potential for enjoyment. The emotional cause-and-effect relationship between the two utterances is driven by the speaker's personal emotional response and their desire for a fun and memorable experience.
