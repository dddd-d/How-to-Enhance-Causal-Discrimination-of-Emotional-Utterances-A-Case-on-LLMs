Implicit:
Q: Here are two utterances and their implicit causes for speakers to say them.                                 Utterance (1): Oh yes , I know which one you mean . I have never been there , but I looked at their menu once and it did look good .The implicit cause of utterance (1) is "The speaker feels delighted in expressing their interest in food exploration and sharing their findings with others."                                 Utterance (2): That's good . See you on Friday .The implicit cause of utterance (2) is "The speaker's affective drive could be the satisfaction of completing a successful interaction, resulting in feelings of happiness."                                 Consider about the content of utterances and their implicit causes, is there a emotional cause-and-effective relationship between the utterance (1) and utterance (2)? Let's think step by step.
A: Step 1: Analyzing the content of utterances (1) and (2):

Utterance (1): The speaker expresses their interest in exploring food and sharing their findings. This implies a positive emotion related to food and discovering new culinary experiences.

Utterance (2): The speaker acknowledges something as "good" and agrees to meet again on Friday. This implies a sense of satisfaction and, possibly, happiness.

Step 2: Identifying the emotional causes of the utterances:

Utterance (1): The speaker's emotional cause is delight and fascination with food exploration.

Utterance (2): The speaker's emotional cause is satisfaction and potential happiness from completing a successful interaction.

Step 3: Assessing the emotional cause-and-effect relationship between the utterances:

There is a potential emotional cause-and-effect relationship between the utterances. Utterance (1) expresses the speaker's enthusiasm and interest in food exploration, which might trigger positive emotions within them. This positive emotional state could then lead to the speaker's satisfaction and happiness in utterance (2), as they agree to meet again.

However, it's important to note that the relationship between these utterances is not explicitly stated or directly causative. The emotional connection between them is hypothetical and subject to interpretation based on the content and context provided.

Q: Judge the direction of the relationship:                                         Dose utterance (1) causes utterance (2) or Dose utterance (2) causes utterance (1) ?
A: Based on the given information, utterance (1) expressing enthusiasm in food exploration and sharing findings does not directly cause utterance (2) where the speaker acknowledges something as "good" and agrees to meet again. 

Therefore, utterance (1) does not directly cause utterance (2).
